# FanDuel - React

This is part two of my coding assessment for FanDuel.

`Please code up the same mock up, this time using a JS Framework of your choice (React, Vue, Angular, Ember are the popular choices). Feel free to use the markup/CSS from the previous step. We have set up a basic REST API (https://my-json-server.typicode.com/fanduel/moneyball-fe-challenge-data/) with the static information needed to fill out the mockup (such as the plays, game information, etc). The goal here is to show that you understand how a UI is constructed in a more complex ecosystem and can properly ingest an API endpoint and include it in a front end application.`
